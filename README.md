# Vert.x Integration Test for OpenShift

If you want to use Minishift for testing, run:

```bash
minishift start --cpus=4 --memory=8192 \
  --deploy-registry=true --deploy-router=true \
  --vm-driver=virtualbox

eval $(minishift docker-env)
```

Some tests require the `oc` command line in the `PATH`.
Don't forget to login as well (user `developer`, password `developer`):

```bash
oc login
```

Test in module can be executed switching to `$PROJECT` directory and running 
 ```bash
 cd $PROJECT
 mvn clean verify -Popenshift
 ```
